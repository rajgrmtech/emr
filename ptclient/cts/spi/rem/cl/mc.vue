<!--
The tree structure is:

Carausel                           |
  -- Carausel item                 |   These are the slides
    -- Cards                       |   Each card is a reminder


Performance:
Inside rem/cl/c.vue:getRemDescUsingCache enable the console.log 
console.log(
        'Inside get desc. Only first time it needs to come from ORM and subsequently it can always come from cache, the value set by setRemDescOn5KeyPress'
      )
When this Ct is mounted it loads the ctChangeRem 204 times since the above console.log is put on console 204 times. 

Every time the slide is changed the getRemDescUsingCache() is again called 204 times since on console.log I see 204 messages

How to solve this?
1. Load with getNumOfCarouselSlides as 2. 
2. Each time prev and next is clicked increment or descrement the local variable currentSlideNumber.
3. getArrayOfRemIDsToShowInThisCard depends on this.diVirtualSlideNumber
