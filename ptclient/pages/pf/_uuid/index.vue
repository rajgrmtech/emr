  <!--  Prop explanation:
          v-on:mouseleave="mouseleave"
          Goal: Make it very easy to get the feed
          When the user takes the mouse to the left edge of the browser then bring the feed up
          Why not put it inside <SplitArea> the event does not get fired.
          Why not put a div inside and then put mouseleave event over there?
            when go from mtsvl to ptsvl the event gets fired.

/*
  Ref: https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-vue
  According to this reference there are two ways of adding Highcharts-Vue wrapper to project:
  1. Registering globally as a plugin
  2. Registering locally in specific component

  Q) Why we are registering 'HighchartsVue' globally as a plugin?
    A) We are doing so for following reasons:
     - If we choose to register it locally in all the components where required a graph/chart, we had to configure it multiple times.
     - Globally registering will help us to make the chart consistent through out the project.
